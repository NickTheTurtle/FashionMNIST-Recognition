# FashionMNIST-Recognition
See website on https://nicktheturtle.github.io/FashionMNIST-Recognition/, which tests against the test images of the data (unseen by algorithm)

The algorithm is based on a trained neural network over the Fashion-MNIST data. This is still a work-in-progress, so the accuracy isn't that high yet (around 81% or so). In addition, I am too lazy to add styling.
